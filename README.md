# Python-Password-Generator-GUI

This program generates 5 strong passwords in the graphical user interface (GUI).
The 5 generated passwords will then appear in a tab that is next to the existing 
"Generator" tab. The program will then proceed to save the passwords in the same
directory as the program. This is a simple program targeted towards people who have trouble
remembering or thinking of passwords.
